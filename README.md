## ✨ Overview

The **Library App** is a dynamic and interactive web application that allows users to manage a personal collection of books. Built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this project showcases core concepts such as object-oriented programming, DOM manipulation, form validation, and responsive design.

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

## 🛠 Features

- 📖 **Add New Books**  
  Input book details using a modal form: title, author, number of pages, and read status.

- 🧾 **Display Books**  
  Books are rendered as styled cards with their information clearly displayed.

- 🔄 **Toggle Read Status**  
  Users can update a book’s read status between "Read" and "Not Read".

- ❌ **Remove Books**  
  Instantly remove a book from the library with a single click.

- 🧪 **Unique Book IDs**  
  Each book is given a unique ID using `crypto.randomUUID()` for reliable identification and management.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Semantic markup structure  
- **CSS3** – Flexbox layout, custom dialog styling, hover/active states  
- **JavaScript** – Object constructors, event listeners, form handling, DOM manipulation

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Practiced encapsulating logic using JavaScript constructors and prototypes.
- Strengthened understanding of `dialog` elements and accessibility-friendly forms.
- Improved skills in dynamically creating and managing DOM elements.
- Learned how to assign and use UUIDs for unique object tracking.

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Add localStorage support to persist the library across sessions.
- Enable book editing (e.g., change title or page count after adding).
- Add form validation feedback for a better user experience.
- Integrate search/filter functionality for large libraries.
